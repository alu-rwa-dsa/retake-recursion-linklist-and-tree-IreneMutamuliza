Part1:
recursive function to count Odd ad even digits.
we first check through the digits one by one and divide by two if the remainder is 0 then the digit is even and if 1 then odd.
we store in variable even or odd to keep track of the count.
we then print out the message accordingly
lastly in the driver code we call the function "recursion" with a string with numbers

part 2:
first step is to create a the circular list
we create a function that counts the nodes
then we add data to the nodes, using the add function.
whenever we add or /delete data the no of nodes changes.

part3:
array implemetation of the Array Based Binary Search Tree
